# 0x00. MySQL advanced

SQL `indexes`, `procedures` and `functions`, `views`, and `triggers` play crucial roles in database management and application development. `Indexes` enhance query performance by optimizing data retrieval, allowing faster searching and sorting operations. `Procedures` and `functions` provide reusable and modular code, promoting code organization, encapsulation, and reducing redundancy. `Views` offer a logical abstraction layer, simplifying complex queries and providing a consistent interface for accessing data. `Triggers` automate actions based on predefined events, ensuring data integrity, enforcing business rules, and facilitating data-driven workflows. Together, these database features enhance efficiency, maintainability, and data integrity, enabling developers to build scalable, performant, and robust applications.
