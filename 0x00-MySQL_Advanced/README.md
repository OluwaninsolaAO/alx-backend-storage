# 0x00. MySQL advanced

SQL indexes, procedures and functions, views, and triggers play crucial roles in database management and application development. Indexes enhance query performance by optimizing data retrieval, allowing faster searching and sorting operations. Procedures and functions provide reusable and modular code, promoting code organization, encapsulation, and reducing redundancy. Views offer a logical abstraction layer, simplifying complex queries and providing a consistent interface for accessing data. Triggers automate actions based on predefined events, ensuring data integrity, enforcing business rules, and facilitating data-driven workflows. Together, these database features enhance efficiency, maintainability, and data integrity, enabling developers to build scalable, performant, and robust applications.
