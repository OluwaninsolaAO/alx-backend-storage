# 0x01. NoSQL

MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performance approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional relational databases, such as SQL-based systems, MongoDB does not rely on fixed schemas or tables. Instead, it uses a document-oriented model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for dynamic and schema-less data structures, making MongoDB well-suited for handling unstructured or rapidly evolving data.
